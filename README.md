# crapsPython
In this project, I made a craps game in python. 
The game includes the very basic rules of craps, on your initial roll if you roll a 7 or 11, you win, roll a 2,3,or 12, you lose, 
and if you roll any other number, that number becomes the point and you keep rolling until you get a 7 and lose or get the point and win. 

The game includes functions, if-else statements, while loops, booleans, and the random package.
